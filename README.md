Operating system code

An opertaing system written with assembly and c, currently consists of a bootsector code, kernel code, drivers (currently for the keyboard and screen), code to interact and handle the cpu, and code to handle with memory and strings.
next i intend to add user mode, i also have already written a more advanced code for the shell that adds more commands and a text editor, but in order to use it i first need to add file management.
i also intend to add networking in the future.
