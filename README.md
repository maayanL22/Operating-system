Operating system code

An opertaing system written with assembly and c, currently consists of a bootsector code, kernel code, drives, code to interact and handle the cpu, and code to handle with memory and strings.
next i intend to add user mode and start implementing protected mode and memory management, i also have already written a more advanced code for the shell that adds more commands, but in order to use it i first need to add file management.
